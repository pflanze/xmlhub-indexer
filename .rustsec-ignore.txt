# `idna` accepts Punycode labels that do not produce any non-ASCII when decoded
# -> idna is used by `trash`, thus only for paths? Also it is only
#    about comparisons returning true after idna when unequal before
#    decoding while being all ASCII, can't see this mattering except
#    perhaps overwriting files in trash?
