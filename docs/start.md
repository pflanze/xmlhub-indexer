# Welcome

The XML Hub is a set of Git repositories with
[BEAST2](https://www.beast2.org/) XML files that could be useful to
learn techniques from. Largely, these are files from real work
(e.g. published papers), thus may also be useful for finding scientists
working in areas similar to what you do.

This is a young project, in fact currently (mid 2025) in a
preview/beta status. We have a [list of planned changes](todo.html)
that we want to carry out, and there is currently only a single repository, by
the [cEvo](XXX) group, with currently only few documents. But we
(cEvo) are going to start adding archived documents and invite
more participation soon, and the service is already usable---we welcome
your contributions! If you have feedback on our approach, please send
[us](about.html) email.

## How it works

Instead of making a centralized web application, with associated risk of
becoming a point of failure, we have decided to follow a "low tech",
distributed approach: to collect XML documents in a set of [Git](XXX)
repositories, roughly one for each entity (e.g. research group) that
doesn't see themselves as contributing to an existing one. These
repositories can be maintained manually, but we provide a [tool](XXX)
to make that easier, and more importantly, to produce an index over
all documents. We also maintain a list of all such repositories, and
provide a joint index over all of them on the BEAST2 website (soon).
Currently we index just a single repository ([the one by cEvo](XXX)),
but this will change as soon as other groups decide to join.
